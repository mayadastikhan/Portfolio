                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Emergency medicine operates in high-pressure, time-sensitive 
                conditions, yet electronic health record (EHR) systems like
                Epic often create workflow inefficiencies that slow down EMTs, 
                ER doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and emergency teams. 
                Our project focused on improving the EMT-to-ER patient handoff 
                process by integrating real-time data sharing, simplifying 
                patient registration, and streamlining medication ordering to 
                enhance hospital preparedness in critical situtations.</p>

              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <p>Emergency room doctors, nurses, and technicians need to quickly capture essential patient data 
                during time-sensitive situations, but current documentation requirements 
                force them to choose between thorough record-keeping and immediate patient 
                care. This trade-off can lead to delayed treatments, increased cognitive 
                strain, and potential gaps in patient records, ultimately compromising both 
                efficiency and patient outcomes.

              <p>
                Climate education often lacks the interactivity needed to drive behavioral change,
                especially in younger audiences. Our mission was to design a fun, engaging game
                that teaches players simple, real-world actionsâ€”like unplugging electronics or
                turning off lightsâ€”to build sustainable habits through repetition and feedback.

                Despite increasing concern about climate change, many young students arenâ€™t
                equipped with the tools to take action. Traditional educational methods fall short
                in fostering long-term engagement and habit formation around energy conservation.

                tailored to younger audiences that also provide immediate, meaningful feedback.
